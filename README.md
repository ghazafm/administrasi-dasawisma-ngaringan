# Administrasi Kependudukan Desa Ngaringan

## Description

This website is designed for managing population administration processes in Ngaringan Village, Blitar Regency. It serves as a central repository for various population-related data, including resident information, family cards, and housing details. Additionally, it contains health data relevant to public health authorities, such as information on pregnant women. The platform is used by village administrators (as supervisors) and dasawisma (data inputters).
